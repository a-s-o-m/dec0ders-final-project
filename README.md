Do you have food lying at the house, but still dont know what to cook?
Well no need to worry for we present to you BiteHunt.

***
BiteHunt is a full stack website where users have the ability to access hundreds of recipes that correlate with the current ingredients they have at home. 
Users will be able to enter their email to get started. With the inputted email address users will then input their current ingredients and based on their input,
hundreds of recipes will be generated. If a user likes a specific recipe they can expand that recipe and look at a more detailed view on the steps, and check to see if they
are missing any ingredients to complete that recipe. If that is the case the user will have the option to add the missing ingredients to their shopping list. 
At the end if the user can return to their shopping list and find all the missing ingredients that they have had saved. Then the user can email themselevs their shopping
list given the provided email at the beginning or they can print out their shopping list and take it to the store with them.
